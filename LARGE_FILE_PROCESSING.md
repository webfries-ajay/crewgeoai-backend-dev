# Large File Processing Enhancements

## Overview

The file service has been enhanced to handle large files (especially TIFF files over 500MB) efficiently using memory management, chunked processing, and progressive downsampling techniques.

## Problem Statement

### Original Issues
- **Memory Exhaustion**: Large TIFF files (500MB+) would cause memory errors when loaded entirely into RAM
- **Thumbnail Creation Failures**: Large images would fail to generate thumbnails due to memory constraints
- **No Memory Management**: The system didn't consider available system memory or file size
- **Inefficient Processing**: All images were processed the same way regardless of size

### Specific Problems with Large TIFF Files
- TIFF files can be extremely large (500MB - 2GB+) due to high resolution and bit depth
- Loading entire large TIFF into memory can consume 2-4x the file size in RAM
- Multiple thumbnail creation would create additional memory copies
- No fallback mechanisms for memory-constrained environments

## Solution Architecture

### 1. LargeFileProcessor Class

A dedicated class that handles large file processing with intelligent memory management:

```python
class LargeFileProcessor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.max_memory_mb = 1024  # 1GB memory limit
        self.large_file_threshold_mb = 100  # Files over 100MB are considered large
        self.tiff_chunk_size = 2048  # 2K chunks for TIFF processing
        self.memory_buffer_mb = 200  # Keep 200MB buffer for system
```

### 2. Memory Management Features

#### Available Memory Detection
```python
def get_available_memory_mb(self) -> float:
    """Get available system memory in MB"""
    try:
        memory = psutil.virtual_memory()
        return memory.available / (1024 * 1024)
    except:
        return 1024  # Default to 1GB if psutil fails
```

#### Memory Usage Estimation
```python
def estimate_image_memory_mb(self, width: int, height: int, mode: str = 'RGB') -> float:
    """Estimate memory usage for an image in MB"""
    bytes_per_pixel = {
        'RGB': 3,
        'RGBA': 4,
        'L': 1,
        'LA': 2,
        'CMYK': 4,
        'P': 1,
        '1': 1
    }
    bpp = bytes_per_pixel.get(mode, 3)
    return (width * height * bpp) / (1024 * 1024)
```

### 3. Intelligent Processing Decision

The system automatically decides whether to use chunked processing based on:

- **File size**: Files over 100MB automatically use chunked processing
- **Available memory**: If system memory is low, chunked processing is used
- **File type**: TIFF files have a lower threshold (50MB) due to their memory-intensive nature
- **Estimated memory usage**: Calculated based on image dimensions and color mode

```python
def should_use_chunked_processing(self, file_path: Path) -> bool:
    """Determine if file should use chunked processing"""
    try:
        file_size_mb = file_path.stat().st_size / (1024 * 1024)
        
        # Always use chunked processing for very large files
        if file_size_mb > self.large_file_threshold_mb:
            return True
        
        # Check available memory
        available_memory = self.get_available_memory_mb()
        if available_memory < self.memory_buffer_mb:
            return True
        
        # For TIFF files, be more conservative
        if file_path.suffix.lower() in ['.tiff', '.tif']:
            return file_size_mb > 50  # Lower threshold for TIFF
        
        return False
        
    except Exception as e:
        logger.warning(f"Error checking file size for chunked processing: {e}")
        return True  # Default to chunked processing on error
```

## Processing Strategies

### 1. Standard Processing (Small Files)
For files under the threshold:
- Load entire image into memory
- Create thumbnails using traditional PIL methods
- Process metadata extraction normally

### 2. Chunked Processing (Large Files)
For files over the threshold:

#### Safe Image Information Extraction
```python
def get_image_info_safe(self, file_path: Path) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Get image information without loading the entire image into memory"""
    try:
        with Image.open(file_path) as img:
            # Don't call img.load() - just get basic info
            info = {
                'width': img.width,
                'height': img.height,
                'mode': img.mode,
                'format': img.format,
                'size_mb': file_path.stat().st_size / (1024 * 1024),
                'estimated_memory_mb': self.estimate_image_memory_mb(img.width, img.height, img.mode)
            }
            return info
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error getting image info for {file_path}: {e}")
        raise
```

#### Progressive Downsampling
For very large images (>500MB estimated memory):

```python
def _create_thumbnail_aggressive_downsampling(self, file_path: Path, target_size: Tuple[int, int], 
                                            output_path: Path, quality: int) -> bool:
    """Create thumbnail using aggressive downsampling for very large images"""
    try:
        with Image.open(file_path) as img:
            # Convert to RGB if needed
            if img.mode != 'RGB':
                # Handle various color modes...
            
            # Calculate intermediate sizes for progressive downsampling
            current_size = img.size
            target_width, target_height = target_size
            
            # Progressive downsampling to avoid memory issues
            intermediate_sizes = []
            while current_size[0] > target_width * 2 or current_size[1] > target_height * 2:
                new_width = max(target_width * 2, current_size[0] // 2)
                new_height = max(target_height * 2, current_size[1] // 2)
                intermediate_sizes.append((new_width, new_height))
                current_size = (new_width, new_height)
            
            # Apply progressive downsampling
            for intermediate_size in intermediate_sizes:
                logger.info(f"Downsampling to intermediate size: {intermediate_size}")
                img.thumbnail(intermediate_size, Image.Resampling.LANCZOS)
                gc.collect()  # Force garbage collection
            
            # Final resize to target size
            img.thumbnail(target_size, Image.Resampling.LANCZOS)
            
            # Create final image with padding
            final_img = Image.new('RGB', target_size, (255, 255, 255))
            paste_x = (target_width - img.width) // 2
            paste_y = (target_height - img.height) // 2
            final_img.paste(img, (paste_x, paste_y))
            
            # Save thumbnail
            final_img.save(output_path, "JPEG", quality=quality, optimize=True)
            
            return True
            
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error in aggressive downsampling: {e}")
        return False
```

## File Service Integration

### Enhanced Image Processing
The `FileService` now automatically routes files to appropriate processing methods:

```python
async def _process_image(self, db_file: File, file_path: Path, db: AsyncSession) -> None:
    """Process image file - extract metadata, create thumbnails with large file support"""
    try:
        logger.info(f"Processing image {db_file.id}: {db_file.original_filename}")
        
        # Check if this is a large file that needs special handling
        if self.large_file_processor.should_use_chunked_processing(file_path):
            logger.info(f"Large file detected, using chunked processing: {db_file.original_filename}")
            await self._process_image_large(db_file, file_path, db)
        else:
            logger.info(f"Standard file processing: {db_file.original_filename}")
            await self._process_image_standard(db_file, file_path, db)
        
        # Extract metadata...
        
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error processing image {db_file.id}: {str(e)}")
        raise e
```

### Large Image Processing
```python
async def _process_image_large(self, db_file: File, file_path: Path, db: AsyncSession) -> None:
    """Process large images using memory-efficient chunked approach"""
    try:
        logger.info(f"Processing large image with chunked approach: {db_file.original_filename}")
        
        # Get image info without loading the entire image
        img_info = self.large_file_processor.get_image_info_safe(file_path)
        
        # Set basic dimensions
        db_file.width = img_info['width']
        db_file.height = img_info['height']
        
        logger.info(f"Image dimensions: {img_info['width']}x{img_info['height']}, "
                   f"Estimated memory: {img_info['estimated_memory_mb']:.1f}MB")
        
        # Create thumbnails using chunked processing
        await self._create_thumbnails_chunked(db_file, file_path, db)
        
        db_file.thumbnail_generated = True
        db_file.preview_generated = True
        
        # Force garbage collection after processing large file
        gc.collect()
        
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error in large image processing {db_file.id}: {str(e)}")
        raise e
```
